# Code for "Knowledge-Guided Manipulation Using Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning"

*This is a placeholder repository for the ICRA 2026 submission #XXXX. The code is currently undergoing finalization and will be released here promptly after the anonymity period ends.*

## Expected Contents
*   Full implementation of the M3PO agent integrated with the dynamic scene graph.
*   Configuration files for all experiments (Franka & UR5).
*   Scripts to reproduce the training and evaluation results.
*   Pre-trained model checkpoints.

## Timeline
*   **Submission Date:** September 16, 2025
*   **Target Code Release Date:** [e.g., January 31, 2026] (We aim to release the code well before the final camera-ready deadline).

We are committed to open research and will ensure this repository is complete and well-documented.
